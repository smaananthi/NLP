## QUERY TRANSLATION
Query translation involves converting a user's search query from one language or syntax to another, enabling interaction with systems and databases. It's vital for multilingual search engines, database management, natural language processing, and cross-language information retrieval. Techniques like machine translation and rule-based methods are used for accurate and efficient translations, ensuring users can search and interact in their preferred language or format.
